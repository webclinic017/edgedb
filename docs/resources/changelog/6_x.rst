:edb-alt-title: Gel v6

To explore the new features, ensure you specify version 6.0 when initializing
your project. Pre-release versions are not considered stable and will not be
automatically suggested:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ gel project init --server-version 6.0-rc.2


Upgrading
=========

.. edb:collapsed::

**Local instances**

To upgrade a local project, first ensure that your CLI is up to date with
:gelcmd:`cli upgrade`. Then run the following command inside the project
directory.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ gel project upgrade --to-testing

Alternatively, specify an instance name if you aren't using a project:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ gel instance upgrade -I my_instance

The CLI will check if your schema can migrate cleanly to Gel 6.0. If any
issues are found, they will be reported.

**Hosted instances**

To upgrade a remote instance, we recommend the following dump-and-restore
process:

1. Gel v6.0 supports PostgreSQL 14 or above. Verify your PostgreSQL version
   before upgrading Gel. If you're using Postgres 13 or below, upgrade
   Postgres first.

2. Spin up an empty 6.0 instance. You can use one of our :ref:`deployment
   guides <ref_guide_deployment>`.

   For Debian/Ubuntu, when adding the Gel package repository, use this
   command:

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ echo deb [signed-by=/usr/local/share/keyrings/gel-keyring.gpg] \
           https://packages.geldata.com/apt \
           $(grep "VERSION_CODENAME=" /etc/os-release | cut -d= -f2) main \
           | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gel.list
       $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gel-6

   For CentOS/RHEL, use this installation command:

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ sudo yum install gel-6

   In any required ``systemctl`` commands, replace ``edgedb-server-5`` with
   ``gel-server-6``.

   For Docker setups, use the ``6.0`` tag.

3. Take your application offline, then dump your v5.x database with the CLI:

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ gel dump --dsn <old dsn> --all --format dir my_database.dump/

   This will dump the schema and contents of your current database to a
   directory on your local disk called ``my_database.dump``. The directory name
   isn't important.

4. Restore the empty v6.x instance from the dump:

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ gel restore --all my_database.dump/ --dsn <new dsn>

   Once the restore is complete, update your application to connect to the new
   instance.

   This process will involve some downtime, specifically during steps 2 and 3.


New features
============

SQL write support
-----------------

You can now use SQL DML (``insert``, ``update``, ``delete``) when connecting to
your |Gel| instance via the PostgreSQL protocol. Our aim is to support most
typical use cases from tools like SQL ORMs and SQL clients.

This allows more developers to use Gel, leveraging our advanced data model,
tooling, and high-performance connection management. Teams can migrate their
existing SQL codebases to Gel without rewriting their queries. Once adopted,
you can gradually take advantage of EdgeQL's powerful query capabilities.

Existing Gel users who already use EdgeQL can benefit too. While some SQL
features like window functions, recursive queries, and explicit locking are not
yet supported, you can use these features in SQL today. We will continue to add
support for more features in the future.

In-place upgrade
----------------

We aim for this version to be the last requiring a full dump and restore
process for major version upgrades. We understand that dump-and-restore is
disruptive, so enabling in-place upgrades will make it easier for teams to
upgrade more frequently.

Query performance observability
-------------------------------

We now store statistics about query performance. These statistics are available
in ``sys::QueryStats`` objects.

.. code-block:: edgeql

  select sys::QueryStats {
    query,
    queryType,
    tag,
    plans,
    total_plan_time,
    mean_plan_time,
    calls,
    total_exec_time,
    mean_exec_time,
  } filter .branch.name = sys::get_current_branch();

More details to come in the reference documentation.

ext::postgis
----------------

We've added support for the popular PostGIS extension for PostgreSQL. This
extension adds support for geographic objects and spatial data types.

std::net
------------

We've introduced a new standard library module for sending network requests,
initially supporting HTTP. This module schedules asynchronous requests and
allows you to poll for responses.

ext::auth
-------------

We've introduced several new features to our authentication extension:

- You can now configure generic OpenID Connect providers.
- If using an OAuth provider that returns an ``id_token`` (like an OpenID
  Connect compatible provider), you will now receive that validated token in
  your callback. This simplifies using some of that data for your own User or
  Profile objects, saving a roundtrip to the identity provider.
- As an alternative (or in addition) to configuring SMTP for sending emails,
  you can now configure a webhook for various authentication lifecycle events.
  Use these webhooks to send custom emails, update analytics, or trigger other
  workflows.
- Previously, a missing PKCE session during email verification was treated as
  an error. Now, we support verifying end-user emails from a different device
  than the one used to start the sign-up or sign-in process. To enable
  verification without PKCE, direct the end-user to attempt a login after
  verifying their email, which will initiate a new flow.

  Previously, the application couldn't identify which identity was being
  created during sign-up until email verification was successful. When
  verification occurred on the same device, it concluded with an auth token,
  allowing the creation of a new ``User`` based on that token's identity. With
  the new process, where users are directed to sign in after email
  verification, there's no clear distinction between a regular sign-in (which
  shouldn't create a new ``User``) and an interrupted sign-up (which should
  create a new ``User``). To address this, we now return an ``identity_id`` in
  the sign-up response, enabling you to create a ``User`` type before the email
  is verified.
- We now configure a development-only SMTP provider for instances hosted on
  our Cloud. This SMTP proxy is heavily rate limited, and requires a fixed
  sender email address. It is intended to be used for development and testing
  purposes. Once you're ready to start sending real emails, you can configure
  your own SMTP provider. We hope this will make it easier to get started with
  a simple email-based authentication flow during early development.
- Handle multiple WebAuthn email factors.
  (:eql:gh:`#7861`)
- Add logs to ``auth`` extension.
  (:eql:gh:`#7944`)
- Migrate ``ext::auth::SMTPConfig`` to ``cfg::EmailProvider``.
  (:eql:gh:`#7942`)
- Allow Magic Link to specify a custom link URL.
  (:eql:gh:`#8030`)
- Do not fail if SMTP provider is not configured.
  (:eql:gh:`#8228`)

**Breaking changes**

- We have moved our SMTP configuration into a new top-level
  ``cfg::SMTPProviderConfig`` configuration object. During the upgrade process,
  your existing SMTP configuration will be migrated to this new object. If you
  have any scripts that configure SMTP directly, update them to use the new
  object.

ext::ai
-----------

- We've updated the built-in list of models from our first-party LLM providers
  to match the latest offerings from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Mistral.
- We now pass LLM configuration query parameters through to the downstream
  provider.
- Add delays to AI embeddings requests based on rate limits provided by
  provider.
- Allow specifying underlying vector dimensions when creating an index.
  (:eql:gh:`#8068`)

Simpler scoping rules
---------------------

We've simplified the scoping rules for queries. See `our RFC 1027 outlining the
changes <https://github.com/geldata/rfcs/blob/master/text/1027-no-factoring.rst>`_.

The RFC highlights two main reasons for removing path factoring: the need to
simplify and enhance the language, and concerns about implementation. Path
factoring is complex and makes it hard to quickly understand a query's
behavior. It also undermines several key design principles of EdgeQL. Although
EdgeQL is intended to be read from top to bottom, path factoring allows later
parts of a query to change its meaning significantly.

By default in 6.0, we will generate new schemas that opt-in to the new scoping
rules. Existing schemas will continue to use the old rules and emit warnings
when queries that trigger the old behavior are encountered at query time.

Command Hooks
-------------

We've added hooks for |gelcmd| CLI operations. Certain operations like
switching branches or applying migrations have a profound effect on the state
of the database. These types of changes may occasionally need to be
synchronized with the rest of the project codebase. Whether it's a need to
re-run some schema introspection tools or some fixture validation or
re-generation tools, we now have a way to add hooks that will automatically
execute after certain commands in your project.

These hooks are declared in the |gel.toml| file. For example:

.. code-block::

    [hooks]
    schema.update.after="scripts/extract_schema_docs.sh"

This would run ``scripts/extract_schema_docs.sh`` script any time the schema
changes (whether due to branch switch or applying a migration). In this
example the script is meant to introspect the schema annotations and
automatically generate some documentation files used in the project. But the
mechanism is flexible enough to be used for automating a variety of project
tasks.

See `our RFC 1028 for more details on the changes
<https://github.com/edgedb/rfcs/blob/master/text/1028-cli-hooks.rst>`_.

File Watchers
-------------

We've also added a way to respond to certain file changes within a project.
The |gel.toml| now supports ``[[watch]]`` configuration to specify the files
being watched and the script to be executed when changes occur. In order to
enable this mode the |gelcmd| ``watch`` command is used.

For example, the following configuration will watch for changes in the queries
files and automatically attempt to re-generate the functions that allow
executing these queries in a type-safe way:

.. code-block::

    [[watch]]
    files = ["queries/*.edgeql"]
    script = "npx @edgedb/generate queries"

Multiple ``[[watch]]`` entries can be added to the |gel.toml| file, so that
you can fine-tune how your project responds to important file changes.

This changes how ``watch`` command functions. By default, ``gel watch`` will
start the watch process and monitor files specified in |gel.toml|. In order to
access the old functionality of ``edgedb watch`` (which was monitoring schema
file changes and automatically applying them to the database) you now need to
run ``gel watch --migrate``.

See `our RFC 1028 for more details on the changes
<https://github.com/edgedb/rfcs/blob/master/text/1028-cli-hooks.rst>`_.


Additional changes
==================

EdgeQL
------

* Free objects no longer have an ``id`` property. This is a breaking
  change, though we expect the real-world impact to be minor. If you
  need a dynamically generated new ID for free objects, it can be
  added manually, using one of our UUID generation functions.

  .. code-block:: edgeql

    select {
        id := uuid_generate_v1mc(),
        property := 'Some string',
    }

* Add ``__default__`` keyword to refer to default value.
  (:eql:gh:`#7214`)

  This keyword allows referring to the default value in ``insert`` and
  ``update`` statements. For example, consider the following schema:

  .. code-block:: sdl

      type Item {
          name: str { default := 'New item' }
      }

  We can then insert a 'New item #1' by using the ``__default__`` value:

  .. code-block:: edgeql-repl

      db> insert Item {name := __default__ ++ ' #1'};
      {default::Item {id: ebcfff62-eb91-11ef-a6b9-5ffb2f0b2940}}
      db> select Item{name};
      {default::Item {name: 'New item #1'}}

* Add support for type expressions in intersections.
  (:eql:gh:`#7172`)

  Allow using ``&`` and ``|`` in expressions like this:

  .. code-block:: edgeql

      select Shape[is Circle | Triangle & HasRightAngle];

* Add array modifying functions :eql:func:`array_set` and
  :eql:func:`array_insert`.
  (:eql:gh:`#7427`)

* Add trigonometry functions.
  (:eql:gh:`#8071`)

  Add :eql:func:`math::pi`, :eql:func:`math::acos`, :eql:func:`math::asin`,
  :eql:func:`math::atan`, :eql:func:`math::atan2`, :eql:func:`math::cos`,
  :eql:func:`math::cot`, :eql:func:`math::sin`, :eql:func:`math::tan`.

* Allow ``update`` and ``delete`` on type intersections.
  (:eql:gh:`#7655`)

  Given types ``A``, ``B``, and ``C``, allows expressions such as:

  .. code-block:: edgeql

      update A[is B & C]
      set { foo := 123 }

* Implement ``\(expr)``-style string interpolation.
  (:eql:gh:`#8210`)

  This enables the following expression:

  .. code-block:: edgeql-repl

      db> select "1 + 1 = \(1 + 1)"
      {'1 + 1 = 2'}

* Allow complex types as function params.
  (:eql:gh:`#7759`)

  Allow functions such as:

  .. code-block:: sdl

      function foo(x: A | B) -> int64 using (x.n);

* Search ``std`` for module name when using ``with`` clause.
  (:eql:gh:`#7753`, :eql:gh:`#7836`, :eql:gh:`#7743`)

  We've consolidated many of the built-in modules as sub-modules under the
  ``std`` umbrella.

* Support accessing link properties through :eql:stmt:`for` bindings.
  (:eql:gh:`#7805`)

  Now you can write something like this:

  .. code-block:: edgeql

      select User {
          cards := ((
              for c in .deck[is HeartsCard]
              select (c.name, c@order)
          )),
      }

* Enable DML in user-defined functions.
  (:eql:gh:`#7945`)

  It is now possible to create this kind of function:

  .. code-block:: sdl

      function add_foo(x: int64) -> Foo using ((
          insert Foo { val := x }
      ));

  A new ``Modifying`` volatility level is introduced to represent this.
  (:eql:gh:`#7808`)

* Support ``drop extension package`` of user-installed extensions.
  (:eql:gh:`#7926`)

* Warn when a ``filter`` clause has ``Many`` cardinality.
  (:eql:gh:`#8089`)

* Mark :eql:func:`assert_exists`, :eql:func:`assert_single`, and
  :eql:func:`assert_distinct`  functions as being ``Immutable``.
  (:eql:gh:`#8292`)

* Expose ``administer statistics_update()``.
